Overview
The goal of the project was for students to set up their virtual machine, link their github account to the terminal and to modify the kernel. Included are the files for Part 2 & 3, hello.c and copy.c respectively. The test files used are also included. All code is included within the project0 subdirectory.

Installation and Setup
No external libraries used in this project.
No dependencies, environmental variables or configuration files need to be set.

Build and Compile
Build the project with: gcc [testFile.c] -Wall -g -o [testFile]
Run the code with: ./[testFile]
[testFile] :  Test file for c program being tested
For the test files I created:
For hello.c: [testFile.c] is [testHello.c]
For copy.c: [testFile.c] is [testCopy.c]

User-Space Drivers
No drivers used within this project

Testing
Part 2: Test file given
Part 3: Base Case
With Part 3 being optional, I decided I wanted test the base case just to make sure my syscall worked
Excepted Input: 2 Strings of the Same Length
Expected Output: “Success”

Troubleshooting

Build and install your customized kernel
Ran into dpkg-buildpackage error when building the kernel.
Steps to complete:
Modified the CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS line to “”
Ran make clean run


Part 3: Add a memory copy to the kernel
Test File always returned -1
Steps to complete:
Needed to add a buffer variable to store get_user value
Needed to build the kernel before testing …
Needed to declare incrementing variable outside of for loop
